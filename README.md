# Dog-Battle-Game-Simulation-Project-1

      ~ Overview ~
Computers are excellent at reading and processing input data that can be compiled into useful analysis or information.
They are so good at doing so, in fact, that we utilise computers to create virtual scenarios using numerous factors and parameters,
allowing us to view the results in a considerably quick time, or sometimes even in real-time.
These scenarios are what we usually refer to as computer simulations.

Running computer simulations enables us to answer certain questions that would not be possible to answer if we were to think,
visualise, and formulate in our small human minds. For example, to accurately predict the daily forecast, meteorologists
have to consider the status of the atmosphere, the humidity level, the rate of temperature change in an area,
the cloud movement or wind direction around the local area, and many other factors.
These factors can be too overwhelming for a normal person to keep track of, especially so when used to predict the weather.
Instead, meteorologists have used computers (or supercomputers) to run physics simulations that can calculate fluid dynamics
and other factors as a whole to more accurately conclude what the weather will be every day.
Simulations benefit us in the field of meteorology, but also in the fields of biology, psychology, economics, sociology, and many others.

In order for us to explore the importance of simulations, what we can infer from the outcomes,
and what strategies or algorithms we can deploy based on the outcome of a simulation, we will need a simple and
interesting problem to simulate (and, of course, a problem that is still computationally feasible for us to solve).
In this project, we will focus on making a simulation of a game that allows us to instantly predict what the outcomes are.
After that, we will explore how we can implement certain optimization algorithms to tell us how to consistently improve our chances of winning the game.

Fun fact
The game that we’ll be simulating here is actually heavily inspired by this online game.
You are free to try and play the original but it is not mandatory to do in order to complete this project,
as we’ll be focusing on a simplified version called Super Auto Canines.
